What does the notation f: A -> B mean?
A function that maps A to B.

What are the criteria for f to be an invertible function?
Invertible functions must be one-to-one (one input must map to only one 
output)
Invertible functions must be onto (each co-domain value must map to an element 
of the domain)

What is associativity of functional composition?
Basically: parantheses are not necessary.

What are the criteria for a function to be a probability function?

What is the Fundamental Principle of Probability Theory?
The probability of an event is the sum of probabilities of outcomes making up 
the event.

If the input to an invertible function is chosen randomly according to the 
uniform distribution, what is the distribution of the output?
If the input is chosen according to a uniform distribution, then the 
distribution of the output is also uniform.
