Name three fields.
* Complex numbers
* Real numbers
* Galois field

What is the conjugate of a complex number? What does it have to do with the 
absolute value of a complex number?
* Conjugate of a complex number is the negative of the imaginary portion of 
  the complex number
* The absolute value of two members of a conjugate pair is the same

How does complex-number addition work?
* Add real parts separately, then add imaginary parts separately

How does complex-number multiplication work?
* Similar to a binomial: FOIL

How can translation be defined in terms of complex numbers?
* Use addition to translate a complex number

How can scaling be defined in terms of complex numbers?
* Multiply by a real to scale complex numbers

How can rotation by 180 degrees be defined in terms of complex numbers?
* Multiply by -1 to rotate by 180 degrees

How can rotation by 90 degrees be defined in terms of complex numbers?
* Multiply by i to rotate by 90 degrees

How does addition of GF(2) values work?
* Addition is modulo 2; simlar to XOR operation

How does multiplication of GF(2) value work?
* Multiplication is the same as ordinary multiplication.
